00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.680
We present TapVid-3d a benchmark for tracking any point in 3d.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.360
Understanding fine-grained motion in 3D facilitates accurate robot manipulation,

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.679
enriches controllable video generation,

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.679
and improves general scene understanding.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.359
In order to measure progress in 3D motion undertanding,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.519
we build the TAPVid-3D benchmark

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.640
a benchmark for tracking any point in 3D.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.720
We achieve this by leveraging three different pre-existing datasets:

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.480
Aria Digital Twin, DriveTrack and Panoptic Studio.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.200
Aria Digital Twins contains real videos with aligned synthetic annotations,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.800
such as depth maps,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.160
segmentation maps,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.039
and 3D bounding boxes.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.680
DriveTrack is derived from the Waymo Open Dataset,

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.280
and contains LIDAR data, as well as 3D bounding boxes.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.640
Panoptic Studio is a multiview dataset,

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.199
on which dynamic 3D gaussian splatting reconstructions

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.640
have been obtained by Luiten et al.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.480
We leverage the 3D data from each of these three datasets

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.719
to obtain ground-truth 3D point trajectories,

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.640
and build TAPVid-3D,

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.759
a large and diverse benchmark for 3D point tracking.

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.720
Our benchmark contains more than 4.5k videos.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.159
each up to 300 frames,

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.360
containing up to 1024 tracked points.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.360
